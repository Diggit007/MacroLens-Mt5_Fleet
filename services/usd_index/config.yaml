  - id: "DEXUSEU"
    name: "US / Euro FX Rate"
    direction: 1 # Note: FRED series is Dollars per Euro. Higher = Weaker USD.
    weight: 0.109 # Positive weight on 'Weaker USD' signal contribution? 
    # If DEXUSEU goes up (USD Weak), Z-score goes up. 
    # If weight is pos, Index goes up. 
    # But Index > 0 means USD Strength?
    # So if DEXUSEU Up -> Index Up -> USD Strong? Contradiction.
    # Calibration says coef is +0.10. 
    # This implies DEXUSEU and DXY move together?? 
    # DXY = ~ 1/EUR. They should be inversely correlated.
